## Design:

The design of the website is made to invite visitors to come, to get to know the gym, the fighting approach and MMA styles, and to book classes and offers.
So I tried to do a simple web with red and black pallete, which is easy to navigate through and pleasant at the same time, also Include some "motivational" pictures of students doing some sparring to show what they will be capable to learn if they decided to join and practice MMA in the gym.

### Design Brief:

+ Colour:

The main colours used in the web are: 

- Dark Red: Symbolism: Red is often associated with passion, strength, and power, which aligns well with the intense nature of MMA. It represents the energy and determination exhibited by fighters in the ring.

Visual Impact: Dark red is a bold and attention-grabbing color. It can help create a strong visual impact and draw visitors' attention to key elements on the website, such as headlines, buttons, or important information.

Contrast and Legibility: Dark red can provide a striking contrast against lighter colors, making it easier to read text and navigate the website. It can enhance legibility and ensure that important information stands out

- Black:  Black can be an effective choice, it's essential to consider the overall design, usability, and accessibility of the website. Proper use of white space, typography, and other design elements will ensure that the website remains visually engaging and user-friendly.

Elegance and Sophistication: Black is often associated with elegance, sophistication, and power. Using black as a dominant color can give the website a sleek and stylish look, creating a sense of professionalism that aligns with the high-level athletic competition in MMA.

- Off-White: Clean and Modern Aesthetic: Off-white is a neutral color that creates a clean and modern look. It provides a sense of simplicity and minimalism, which can be visually appealing and make the website feel more contemporary.

Focus on Content: Off-white backgrounds can help draw attention to the content on the website, such as images, videos, and written information. The neutral color allows the content to take center stage without distractions, ensuring that visitors can easily engage with the MMA-related information.

Contrast and Readability: Off-white provides a good contrast against darker text, making it easier to read. This is particularly important for websites that contain a lot of textual information or articles related to MMA events, techniques, or fighter profiles.



- Links : The colour of the Links to navigate in the index.html are off-white with the purpose to made easy to users to identify that they are external links.

+ Typography:

- Rubik Wet Paint = Logo

- Roboto Slab = Section Headings

- PT Sans = Paragraphs

+ Images:

- Background Image/ Hero Image/ home page: I used a image of a man posing in a MMA stance using the the same color pallete to match the rest of the website, to provide light and flowing website.

- Sections images: In the other sections I used images of MMA coaches doing some fancy poses to try to create some motivation in  users, to invited them to start or keep practicing MMA.

- Classes image: I choose a picture where coaches are sparring, to show the hardwork involved in classes at Savage Strike MMA
